## How to improve the performance of object detection system

### Problem

Object detection is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos. There are several key steps in existing object detection systems, such as hypothesizing bounding boxes, resampling pixels or features for each box, and applying a high- quality classifier. Two fractions develop gradually because of different kernel goal. The two-stage detectors focus on the accuracy of object detection, which first generates a set of candidate bounding boxes and then  selects and revises target bounding boxes, such as, R-CNN [1], Fast R-CNN [2], Faster R-CNN [3], Mask R-CNN [4], FPN [5]. In contrast, the one-state detectors focus on the efficiency of object detection, which regresses object boxes directly in an end-to-end framework, such as, SSD [6], YOLO [7], YOLOv2 [8], RetinaNet [9].

In this article, I fuse YOLO and YOLOv2 as the basic model and propose several techniques and tricks to improve the performance of object detection system. In order to experiments the model, I use benchmark dataset (PASCAL-VOC 2012) [10]. Here is the step of downloading and processing the dataset.

```shell
1. mkdir `datasets` in the root directory
2. cd `datasets`
3. wget `http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/~mooyeol/pascal_voc_2012/VOCtrainval_11-May-2012.tar`
4. tar -xvf VOCtrainval_11-May-2012.tar
Now there is a directory `VOCdevkit` in `yolo-tensorflow/datasets/`
5. cd .. to root directory
6. python -m src.tools.datasets
Now there is a directory `voc` in `yolo-tensorflow/datasets`
```
